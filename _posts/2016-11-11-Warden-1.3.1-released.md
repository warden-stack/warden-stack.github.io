title: Warden 1.3.1 released
---

The new version of [Warden](https://getwarden.net) has been released. It's not as big update, as the version 1.3.0, however it contais some minor updates towards making the Warden extensions available cross-platform.
All of the packages (core, watchers and integrations) are ready to be installed via NuGet.

### Cross-platform updates

The following packages now work correctly with .NET Core framework:

- [Disk Watcher](https://github.com/warden-stack/Warden/wiki/Watcher-type-Disk)
- [MongoDB Watcher](https://github.com/warden-stack/Warden/wiki/Watcher-type-Redis)
- [Redis Watcher](https://github.com/warden-stack/Warden/wiki/Watcher-type-MongoDB)
- [SendGrid Integration](https://github.com/warden-stack/Warden/wiki/Integration-with-SendGrid)

For the _SendGrid_ integration I implemented a temporal (hopefully) solution based on _HttpClient_ library. It supports both - raw email messages (text or HTML) and transactional templates, the only difference is that you can no longer use username & password for authentication - only API key is supported. I hope that _SendGrid_ dev team will implement soon the official client. 

### Remote machine support for performance watcher

From now on, you can configure [Performance Watcher](https://github.com/warden-stack/Warden/wiki/Watcher-type-Performance) to connect to the remote host - just make use of the optional parameter _machineName_.

### Updated tests

Test projects were updated to work with the latest version of [MSpec](https://github.com/machine/machine.specifications), which means you can run them on .NET Core platform.

### Contribution guidelines

In order to make it simpler for all of the great people out there that support this project either by reporting issues or creating the new pull requests, I added a short article about [contributing](https://github.com/warden-stack/Warden/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Next steps

We're working on the [Warden Stack](https://github.com/warden-stack) which will be built as a set of microservices with the API acting as a gateway on top and of course a new web applicaton for the end users.
The whole stack will be available to run within a _Docker_ containers, so if you would like to host everything on your own it will be very simple - just run a _docker-compose_ and you're good to go.
We're aiming to have the first version of this stack ready (including a web application with basic metrics) till the end of the year.

And that's the first grasp of the new UI concept (colors and the general idea).
