title: Warden 1.3.2 released & new Web App UI designs
---

The new version of [Warden](https://getwarden.net) has been released. It's a rather minor update concerning only core Warden package, however it includes a feature that I was asked for a quite some time - a possibility to dynamically reconfigure the already existing Warden instance. 

### Reconfiguration

In order to reconfigure the already existing **Warden** instance, please make use of the available method **Reconfigure()** which exposes the fluent builder via **Action** lambda expression, that will update the already existing configuration dynamically. From now on you can also remove the previously added watchers, for example like this:

```csharp
var warden = WardenInstance.Create(configuration);
warden.Reconfigure(cfg => cfg.AddWatcher(watcherInstance)
                             .RemoveWatcher("my-watcher"));
```

### Redis watcher update

There was a [PR #136](https://github.com/warden-stack/Warden/pull/136) back then, which fixed a bug about invalid handling of the closed connections. The [Redis watcher](https://github.com/warden-stack/Warden/wiki/Watcher-type-Redis) was also updated to the version 1.3.2.

### Next steps

We're still working on the [Warden Stack](https://github.com/warden-stack) and eventually getting the new UI designs that will be ready to apply to the web application. Also, the whole microservices stack is evolving, so still, it's going to take us some time to adapt these new patterns, but it will be worth waiting. Just take a look at our latest designs! :)
