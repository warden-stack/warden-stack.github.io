title: Warden 1.3.0 released
---

It's been 2 months since the latest version of the [Warden](https://getwarden.net) has been released as the NuGet packages. Although our focus (yes, I'm not the only one person anymore working on this project) has moved towards the development of so-called stack (brand new API, Website, Microservices etc.) I'm still actively developing the core library in order to make it even more useful than before.

### Warden Manager

The [Warden Manager](https://github.com/warden-stack/Warden/wiki/Warden-Manager) is the latest feature that allows to control the instance of the [IWarden](https://github.com/warden-stack/Warden/wiki/Warden). What does it mean in practice? By using the _Manager_, you are able to "pack" (or "box") the existing instance of the _IWarden_ and provide a so-called _CommandSource_ (along with the _EventHandler_, yet it's not required) in order to be able to control the Warden process for example via an external application. You can send the commands like _PauseWarden_, _PingWarden_ or even _KillWarden_ using the service bus or any other mechanism that you prefer. These commands will be immediately processed and they will also return an event that you can hook up into if you need a sort of acknowledgment response. 
There are 2 new sample applications under the Examples directory in the [repository](https://github.com/warden-stack/Warden/tree/master/src/Examples) using the [Rebus](https://github.com/rebus-org/Rebus). In order to run them, make sure you've enabled the MSMQ and run the _Warden.Examples.CommandsAndEvents.Manager_ application first in order to create a queue that will be used by the _Warden.Examples.CommandsAndEvents.App_.

```csharp
var wardenManager = WardenManager.Create(warden, cfg =>
{
    cfg.SetCommandSource(() => CommandSource)
        .SetEventHandler(() => EventHandler);
});
```

### Logger

[Logging](https://github.com/warden-stack/Warden/wiki/Logger) messages (hooks invocation, watcher checks, errors etc.) is another feature available in the latest release of the Warden. You can use the logging e.g. either for debugging or informational purposes. There are 4 logging levels: _Error_, _Info_, _Trace_ and _All_ and a built in console logger (yes, it even does have a neat colors) that you can integrate with a single line of code:

```csharp
WithConsoleLogger(minLevel: WardenLoggerLevel.Info, useColors: true);
```

You can also create your own logger, just implement the _IWardenLogger_ interface and make use of the _SetLogger()_ function.

### Updated extensions

Thanks to the [contribution](https://github.com/warden-stack/Warden/pull/112) from the [samjudson](https://github.com/samjudson) the [Process Watcher](https://github.com/warden-stack/Warden/wiki/Watcher-type-Process) now allows to provide an optional parameter for specifying the remote server address. 
The [Cachet](https://cachethq.io/) [integration](https://github.com/warden-stack/Warden/wiki/Integration-with-Cachet) has been also fixed thanks to the [feedback](https://github.com/warden-stack/Warden/issues/104) from the [janpieterz](https://github.com/janpieterz) - the watchers can be grouped now, and there's no more "spamming" about the valid check results if not specified explicitly. There's also an ongoing [discussion](https://github.com/warden-stack/Warden/issues/115) about refactoring the already existing [MSSQL Watcher](https://github.com/warden-stack/Warden/wiki/Watcher-type-MSSQL) into something more generic that would also work with the other databases such as Oracle or MySQL. And since we're working on the new [API](https://github.com/warden-stack/Warden-API), I've managed to extend the [HTTP API Integration](https://github.com/warden-stack/Warden/wiki/Integration-with-HTTP-API) with the new methods that will allow for the seamless integration.

### Next steps

The core Warden repository remains under the active development and all of the [pull requests](https://github.com/warden-stack/Warden/pulls), as well as the feedback reported as [issues](https://github.com/warden-stack/Warden/issues) is greatly appreciated. On the other hand, we've integrated the API with [auth0](https://auth0.com) for the users authentication, [SignalR](http://www.asp.net/signalr) and a very cool [RethinkDB](https://www.rethinkdb.com) that I've found out quite recently. There's also a very new [Services](https://github.com/warden-stack/Warden-Services) repository, as I'm already thinking in terms of scalability using the service bus and microservices hype.
The [Web](https://github.com/warden-stack/Warden-Web) project contains more than a single page and is built on top of the [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io) framework. And all of that works with the [Spawn](https://github.com/warden-stack/Warden-Spawn) project (thanks to the service bus), so hopefully by the end of this year, there will be the first real MVP with a totally new UI and at least a part of the cool features that we have in mind.
