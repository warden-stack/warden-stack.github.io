title: Warden update .NET 4.6.1 & DotNet 5.6
---

Thanks to the contribution from [Mattias](https://github.com/nimatt), [Warden](https://getwarden.net) and all of it's packages have been updated to the latest version of the framework which is *.NET 4.6.1.* and accordingly the cross-platform packages have been upgraded to use the *NETCoreApp* including *DotNet 5.6* & *DNX Core 5.0*.

On top of that, both the *MS SQL* [integration](https://github.com/warden-stack/Warden/wiki/Integration-with-MSSQL) and [watcher](https://github.com/warden-stack/Warden/wiki/Watcher-type-MSSQL) support .NET Core framework due to the latest version of the [Dapper](https://github.com/StackExchange/dapper-dot-net) that is compatible with this platform. 

*Warden* packages are versioned as 1.2 and are available on *NuGet*.
